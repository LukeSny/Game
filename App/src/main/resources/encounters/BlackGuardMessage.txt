As your party enters the ruins of a once great watch tower,
you are treated to the view of an old fight. The ground strewn about
with bodies and blood. At the center of the century old mayham is a man
clad in all black armor. As your party moves to inspect, several bandits
step out of the cracks weapons raised

The aftermath

The would be bandits lay dead at your feet. As your party wipe the blood
from their weapons, you make your way over to the soldier clad in black
armor. In his pocket hides a note that is surprisingly well maintained
given its age.
"To the prestigious King of Atlasom, the Northern Watch is once again
pleading for your support. We have reason to believe the demons of the
north are again ready to challenge the world of Man."
If only this message reached its destination... oh who are you kidding,
The King of Atlasom would not have lifted a finger for the Northern Watch.
The Watchman's sword lays at his side. The Watch's black blades were made to
protect men from the darkest threats. It will do so once again with you.
